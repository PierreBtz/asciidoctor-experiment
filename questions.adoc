= Opened Questions

Here are the questions I did not answer (yet...).

* What about injecting the document version number?
* CI/CD integration
* HTML output can be captured into a variable, maybe possible to integrate in some other devs?
* Need to test docbook backend (to convert to pdf later?)
* Could not find asciidoctor-pdf and asciidoctor-epub3 as indicated in the doc. Did I miss something?
* I currently inlined the images in the document, it's probably proper to leave them outside.
* What about styling? According to the documentation it seems easy, but I need to test.
